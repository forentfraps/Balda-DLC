  '-' will start fetching words, according to provided letters, above the red field is a status label, which is dynamically updated

## Notes
Algorithm is written for  https://logic-games.spb.ru/balda

Due to chat being useless its now replaced with the provided GUI(Atleast my attempts of creating it)

Due to a wordlist not being public, it is shipping in crypted.txt (it is encrypted)

Thus, the first start will initialize the wordlist, hence somewhat keeping the intellectual property intact

'-' Means an empty letter

Use Russian lowercase letters
