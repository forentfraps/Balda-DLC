# Balda-DLC

## Usage
  - ```pip install -r -requirements.txt``` (Do it once to install dependancies)
  - Change prompt5.txt according to your needs
  - ```python solver.py```

## Notes
Algorithm is written for  https://logic-games.spb.ru/balda

Due to a wordlist not being public, it is shipping in crypted.txt (it is encrypted)

Thus, the first start will initialize the wordlist, hence somewhat keeping the intellectual property intact

'-' Means an empty letter

Use Russian lowercase letters
